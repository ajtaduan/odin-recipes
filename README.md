# Odin Recipes

This is my **Odin Recipes** project, part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.  
It is a simple website that showcases different recipe pages using only **HTML**.

## Project Overview
The project contains:
- A main `index.html` page with links to individual recipes.
- Separate recipe pages (`lasagna.html`, `sinigang.html`, `paksiw.html`) each with:
  - An image of the dish
  - A short description
  - A list of ingredients
  - Step-by-step cooking instructions

## What I Learned
- How to structure a webpage using **headings, paragraphs, lists, and images**.
- The difference between **relative** and **root-relative** links for images and navigation.
- How to use **Git** for version control:
  - `git add` to stage changes
  - `git commit -m` to save changes with a message
  - Committing single files, multiple files, or even the whole project
- The importance of writing **clear commit messages**.
- Basic project organization (keeping HTML files in the root and images in a folder).

## Reflection
This project helped me practice the fundamentals of HTML and Git.  
I also learned the importance of small, meaningful commits and how to clearly describe my changes.  
Looking back, I can see how my understanding of file structure, paths, and Git commands has grown.

## Next Steps
- Improve the design by adding **CSS** for better styling.
- Explore linking more recipes.
- Experiment with hosting the project online using GitHub Pages.
